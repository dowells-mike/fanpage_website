                        <div class="text">My name is Mike Dowell's Siegni, I was born in Douala, Cameroon in a small family of 4 members, parents excluded. I have lived there for most of my life and finished primary and secondary school. Shortly after, I made my way to Ireland to study after a long year of hard work between gathering the necessary documents for my trip and the final exam which was the GCE Advanced level. I am very grateful to my parents and uncles who fought so hard to make it happen.</div>

                        <div class="text">I have recently travelled to Ireland where I am currently living alone in Cork and attending Griffith College. There I am studying computing science where I would say I am doing quite well. Actually, I don't really have any problems with my studies. I have also made some friends. Life abroad is very expensive compared to my country. I was surprised at first, but I got used to it little by little</div>

                        <div class="text">Speaking of my passions, I have several. First of all, I have always loved to draw since I was a child, it has always been my favourite hobby. My parents noticed this when I was 2 years old and often sent me to local art schools, but from the very first moments I felt out of place, the level I was looking for was higher than that of the latter. I also like to play soccer with friends. I played in a soccer club in my neighbourhood and played some national championships there. From time to time, playing video games is also exciting. Like FIFA, which has always been a childhood favourite for young people of my age</div>

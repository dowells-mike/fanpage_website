                    <h1>ACTION</h1>
                    <p>The anime action genre depicts extremely high levels of intensity. The shows in this genre are frequently filled with thrilling battles and action-packed fight scenes. These series will either make you jump or knock your socks off. Overall, the action genre features a lot of battle scenes, fluid animation, and highly engaging elements that will get your adrenaline pumping!</p>

                    <h1>ADVENTURE</h1>
                    <p>The adventure genre is about traveling and embarking on an adventure in a specific location or around the world (which may sometimes escalate to the whole universe or even to the other dimensions). The main characters in this genre rarely stay in one place. They travel to various locations, usually with a specific goal in mind (e.g. searching for treasure, exploring some new place, defeating a heinous villain, or saving the world). Adventure anime is so broad and adaptable that it can usually span a large number of episodes while also overlapping with multiple genres, most notably action.</p>

                    <h1>COMEDY</h1>
                    <p>The primary goal of the comedy genre is...you guessed it...to make you laugh! It's a failure if it doesn't make you laugh or at least make you giggle. However, humor can vary depending on your personal sense of humor. The animation may not be as impressive as that of action and drama TV shows, but it can be overlooked for the laughs. The comedy genre in anime covers all of these things: funny moments, hilarious scenes, wacky dialogue, and comical happenings!</p>

                    <h1>DRAMA</h1>
                    <p>The drama genre excels at bringing us to tears and a flood of emotions! Drama anime tends to connect viewers to the characters' experiences. As a result, viewers can feel what the characters are feeling. The goal of these series is to touch our hearts, whether through a tickle of emotion or a barrage of feelings.</p>

                    <h1>SLICE OF LIFE</h1>
                    <p>When someone says "slice of life," they're referring to the mundane good ol' life. This genre's stories are realistically set in the realm of real life. Nothing out of the ordinary occurs, but that's the point! Everyday life is depicted realistically, with nothing out of the ordinary destabilizing the premise.</p>

                    <h1>FANTASY</h1>
                    <p>The fantasy genre in anime primarily deals with fantasy worlds and surreal events and locations. Most of the time, the setting is in a magical world where the characters start an adventure. Sometimes they get sent there from the real world. Magic is oftentimes a component of this genre, and various mystical elements serve as the building blocks of the story.</p>

                    <h1>MAGIC</h1>
                    <p>Magic, in all its essence, is about magical stuff like spells and incantations. It can also include magical sources, beings that grants wishes, and good ol’ sleeve tricks. </p>

                    <h1>SUPERNATURAL</h1>
                    <p>When one says supernatural, they’re referring to stuff or events that are odd and out-of-the-blue. For this category, supernatural might refer to something mythical, mystical, bizarre, or something outside the bounds of accepted reality.</p>

                    <h1>HORROR</h1>
                    <p>It’s not difficult to spot the horror genre in anime. Usually, if there are ghosts, monsters, gore, and creeps, then you’re likely watching a horror series. Heavy gore and bloody violence is a common trait.</p>

                    <h1>MYSTERY</h1>
                    <p>If there’s one thing that’s similar in all mystery anime shows, it is the existence of a central enigma. Whether it’s an event, a place, or an item, there’s some sort of mystery surrounding the narrative.</p>

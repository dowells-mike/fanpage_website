                        <div class="main-text">
                            The first reason I choose Messi is the inspiration he gave me as a child. Just seeing him on the field fascinated me, as well as his simplistic style of play and the unusual things he did in the games. The fact that he is considered by many as the best player in the world is also an inspiration. It pushes me to give the maximum in what I do. The most striking thing is the fact that he is rather modest and reserved by nature, a rather introverted and humble personality that I draw inspiration from. Not only did he have health problems that prevented him from playing professionally, but, on top of that, you can't say that he was from a wealthy family. What for most people would have been their point of disengagement, instead pushed him to prove that soccer needed him and his determination took him to the top of his field. Everything he does on the field is almost unnatural, impossible to replicate, or even mind-boggling. He is feared and respected by most, if not all, soccer players. This is what makes him a role model and a pillar to follow.
